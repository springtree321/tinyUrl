# Playgourd for us to try out anything we want

# Use Vagrant to create uniform development and testing environment

## Setup

- Install VirtualBox from:Â [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)


- Install Vagrant from:Â [http://downloads.vagrantup.com](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)


- After you have installed VirtualBox and Vagrant on your computer, check out our repo on github:`git clone git@github.com:zhewangjoe/full-stack-tinyurl.git`. Make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.

## Starting VMs

- Change directory to the project playground
  > cd full-stack-tinyurl/playgroud

- You can take a look at the Vagrantfile, or not


- Start your VM by type in:
  > vagrant up s1

  First time running it will be slow as Vagrant is pull the Ubuntu image from [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/). However, the bootstrap.sh will be executed everytime when you run this command. So you may want to utilize the snapshot function to take a snapshot once it's done (you can do this later).

  * NOTE: If this step is super slow, especially for those in China, you can follow below steps alternatively.
    1. Use any download tools to download the Ubuntu image separately from below url, or any url shown in the output message of the vagrant up command: 
       https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64/versions/20160801.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box
    2. Manually add the .box image to Vagrant
      * For Mac/Linux/Unix, run: `vagrant box add ubuntu-trusty64 path/to/virtualbox.box`
      * For Windows, run: `vagrant box add ubuntu-trusty64 file:///c:/path/to/virtualbox.box` (if the downloaded .box file is in C drive)
    3. Run the vagrant command again: `vagrant up s1`

- After the startup is done, record the time you spent approxmately to get to this stage

- Now run:
  > vagrant destroy -f

- Then run:
  > vagrant up s1
  
  again, and let me know on Wechat the time you spent this time and last time

- Now you can type in:
  > vagrant ssh s1

  To login the your VM. If you need to use root user, type in:
  > sudo su -
